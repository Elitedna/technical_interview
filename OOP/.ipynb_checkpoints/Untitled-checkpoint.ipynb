    "Design and structure a program that will be used to pay providers (employees) based on how many clients they have seen within the given dataset; The program should be able to output a \"paystub\" like excel/csv file per each provider, resulting in how many patients were seen per each procedure code with the correlating rates, and totals.\n",

    "#### 2) The patients Insurance\n",
    "Most times the providers will be paid the same per each insurance. However your program/design should be able to take in special configurations if needed.\n",

    "#### 3) The licensure status of the provider.\n",
    "Providers are either licensed or unlicensed. The rates per procedure code differ between the two.\n"
